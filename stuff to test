TODO - Check linearity of real time for execution : make scripts

Defaults for a blank map:
map size: 200 x 200 
number of steps: 25,000 it's halfway between the minimum and the maximum of nos that we want to try and refer to the paper (50000)
number of agents: 10 because if the relation is more than linear the execution time would decrease pleasantly
number of targets: 10 it's already what they use in the 500x500 maps

size increments of 100 down to 100
steps incremenst of 1000 up to 50000 keeping the number of agents
number of agents from 2 to 20 with step 2 units
number of targets from 5 to 20 with steps of 5
